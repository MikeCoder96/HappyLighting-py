# HappyLighting Python
Do you recognize the logo? Yes? So, I'm sure you are tired like me about this crappy app. 
This repo was built reversing the original APK and replicated the BLE communication but with intention to extend the features.

The repo was tested on Windows 10/11.

There is also a UWP App for Windows [here](https://github.com/MikeCoder96/HappyUltraLighting-UWP)

### How to use?

PyQT was implemented in order to make discover and connection easy.
