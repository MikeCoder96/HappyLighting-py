# How To

First of all you need python. 
For Windows download the latest version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

For Linux download by running ```apt install python3```

After installed Python, the procedure is the same for both OS. 
Open the terminal inside the folder "LEDStripController" and run these commands:

```
# First, download the requirements by running
pip install -r requirements.txt

# After that, run the app by run
python3 pyhl.py

# Enjoy
```
If you are on Linux, probably you need to install 2 more dependencies, in a console run:
```apt install libasound-dev portaudio19-dev -y```
